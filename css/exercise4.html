    Supercell is a Finnish mobile game development company based in Helsinki, Finland. Founded in May 2010, the company's<br>
    debut game was the browser game Gunshine.net, and after its release in 2011, Supercell started developing games for<br>
     mobile devices. Since then, the company has fully released five mobile games: Hay Day, Clash of Clans, Boom Beach,<br>
    Clash Royale, and Brawl Stars, which are freemium fast-paced games and have been very successful for the company,<br>
    the first two generating revenue of $2.4 million a day in 2013. Following its rapid growth, Supercell opened additional<br>
    offices in Tokyo, Shanghai, San Francisco, and Seoul.

    <h2>Business model</h2>
    <p>
        Supercell focuses on the development of free-to-play games that yield profits through the in-game micropayments.<br>
        The company's objective is to focus on the successful games that stay popular for years. The focus has not been on<br>
        revenue, but on the principle "just design something great, something that users love."[4] Game development focuses<br>
        around "cells" of five to seven people which start with idea generation and an initial review by CEO Paananen.<br> 
        The team subsequently develops the idea into a game, which the rest of the company's employees get to play-test,<br>
        followed by play-testing in Canada's iTunes App store; if the Canada reception is good, the next step is global<br>
        rollout (via iTunes). Supercell has discontinued a total of 14 game projects it did not deem promising enough,<br>
        successful failures which are celebrated by employees.[4] One of the games that was cancelled well into development<br>
        was Battle Buddies, which had also been rated well in the test market, but the number of players was still too small.<br>
        The final decision for cancelling a project is done by the development team themselves.
